This repository serves as place to store my attempts to recreate Economist Graphic Detail visualisations.

My interest in trying to recreate these graphics is to improve my skills in:

* creating fake data for use in mocking-up plots; and
* working with niche aspects of the `ggplot2` framework.

Each folder is named using the data the visualisation was released.

_My attempt to recreate the July 10th 2021 graphic. The original can be found in the "2021_07_10" folder._
